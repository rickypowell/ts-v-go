# Typescript vs Go

This is a simple example that attempts to show the difference in between
Typescript and Go programming languages when parsing JSON strings and
transforming the data. This example can be expanded upon to further explore
more types of JSON structures.

## Typescript code

install with `npm install`

run with `npm run start`

## Go code

run with `go run main.go`
